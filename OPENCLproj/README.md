# **Bitonic Sort**

## How to build my project:
```
$ cmake -B build && cd build
$ cmake --build .
```

## Compiler settings:
```
$ std=c++17, O2, (-Wall -Wextra | /W4)
```

## To run the program, enter
```
$ ./sort
```
---
## Input data:
```
N - size of array
N - numbers
```
## Output data:
```
The sorting array
```

## I choose the first platform, which have GPU device, but if you want run this code on platform "NVIDIA CUDA" add -DNVIDIA=on in cmake params. Also you can specialize the kernel code file by specifying -DKERNEL_SOURCE=filename in cmake params.
---
## If you want to check correct of this program you should run 
```
$ cmake --build . --target check_correct
```
## If you want to compare speed of this program on your GPU device with std::sort you should run
```
$ cmake --build . --target check_perf
```
### If you want check perf on your test for not integer you should set in cmake params -DPERF_TEST_TYPE=type and run from build
```
$ cd tests && ./perf_testing arg1
```
### where "arg1" it is source file name

# I implemented parallel variant of bitonic sort on GPU. You can find all idea of sort [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitonic_sorter). Next I will give the measurement readings on my device

## On my GPU (NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060) and CPU (AMD Ryzen 5 3550H) I got this data

## I compare cl::Buffer and SVM (You can add -DSHARED in cmake params for using shared memory instead cl::Buffer (LOCAL_SIZE=64)):

## I compare speeds of different local sizes (You can define it by yourself in cmake params -DLOCAL_SIZE=value (64 by default)):
